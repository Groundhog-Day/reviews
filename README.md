## CRUD

Gal has provided me with a GET endpoint that he developed for FEC.
(Located in "Service Plan for Reviews.txt")
This endpoint satisfies the "R" in crud, but he did recommend
some modifications that I should make to his schema. For example,
he says airBnB has deprecated review tags, so I can remove all
of the booleans included in his original schema. The changes I
am making to the schema are reflected below, along with the new
GET endpoint as well as three other new enpoints to satisfy the
rest of CRUD.
